## 👋 Hello!

My name is Arnav! I've been coding since I was eight, creating numerous websites and computer-based projects as a passionate hobbyist developer. My most significant project is [BubbleOS](https://github.com/arnavt78/bubbleos), a shell with over 6,000 lines of code still being worked on today. My primary expertise lies in JavaScript, web technologies, and Node.js, though I occasionally work with Python.

I enjoy coding, playing Minecraft, and making YouTube videos about Windows!
