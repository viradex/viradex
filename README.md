## ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

My online username is Viradex, but my real name is Arnav! I've been coding since I was eight, creating numerous websites and computer-based projects as a hobbyist developer. My most significant project is [BubbleOS](https://github.com/arnavt78/bubbleos), a shell with many commands and functions still being worked on today. My primary expertise lies in JavaScript and Python.

I enjoy coding, playing games such as Minecraft, and making YouTube videos!
